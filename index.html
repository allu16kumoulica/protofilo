<h4>Under the guidance of Prof. Ramakrishna</h4>
<h5>Jun 2023-Aug 2023 </h5>
            <p>Worked on multiple cutting-edge research projects focused on steganography and steganalysis using deep learning techniques, exploring the detection of hidden information within digital images. Additionally, I worked on image noising and denoising using the MNIST dataset to study the robustness of neural networks against noisy data.
Collaborated on a project involving 3D image modeling and data augmentation for long-tailed instance segmentation, where I utilized Blender (3D modeling software) to generate realistic synthetic 3D images. These synthetic datasets were instrumental in enhancing model performance for rare classes in imbalanced datasets. This internship provided hands-on experience in deep learning, image processing, synthetic data generation, and advanced data augmentation strategies.</p>

        <h3>A Construction of Smart Grid Authentication and Key Agreement System Using ECC Cryptography</h3>
        <p> The smart grids consists different components. These components include corrosion resistant paint, gas pipelines, massive high voltage transformers. One of the most vital component of smart grid is smart-meter. Throughout this work, we examined the safety and security of the smart grid (SG) authentication protocols. One significant security challenge with Smart Grid is the provision of authentication and keys. Our analysis of security has demonstrated that the proposed framework satisfies the security requirements for smart grid applications, and our cost benefit analysis has been demonstrated. We have analysed the performance the protocol, and it is more secure than existing one. </p>
